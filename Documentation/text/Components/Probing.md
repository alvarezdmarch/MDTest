Probes the simulation

#### Input
* ##### R 
Set to true to run the probing
* ##### C 
Case to probe
* ##### P 
Name of this probing
* ##### I 
Probing interpolation scheme. 0 =  cell; 1 =  cellPoint; 2 = cellPointFace; 3 = pointMVC; 4 = cellPatchConstrained
* ##### F 
Fields to probe. T = air temperature; Tl = Tl; U = wind velocity; alphat = turbulent thermal diffusivity; epsilon = turbulent dissipation rate; k = turbulent kinetic energy; nut = turbulent diffusivity; p = pressure; p_rgh = modified pressure without hydrostatic effects; rho = rho; rs = rs; w = humidity ratio
* ##### P 
Points to probe the simulation

#### Output
* ##### C
Probed case. Use GetProbes component to retrieve probe data
